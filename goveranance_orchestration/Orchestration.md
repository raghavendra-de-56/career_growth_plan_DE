## Orchestration (Data Pipeline Management)

### What It Is:
Orchestration is the coordination of automated tasks (ETL/ELT jobs, validations, alerts) across a data pipeline in a defined order, with error handling and retries.

### Key Tools:

1. Apache Airflow
2. Databricks Workflows
3. Dagster / Prefect (modern alternatives)

### Key Concepts:

1. DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
2. Scheduling & Dependencies
3. Retries and Failover
4. Notification/Alerting (Slack, email, etc.)
5. Parameterization & Environment config
6. Dynamic task generation

### Real-World Use Case (IoT Analytics):

1. Ingest raw IoT data (Kafka/S3 to Delta)
2. Run data quality checks
3. Transform & enrich data
4. Aggregate for reporting
5. Notify downstream systems (Slack/API trigger)

### Best Practices:

1. Use separate DAGs per domain or SLA-critical path
2. Add retries, SLAs, and alerts
3. Monitor orchestration logs centrally (e.g., Airflow logs via S3/Datadog)
4. Store orchestration state externally (e.g., Airflow metadata DB)
