Apache Spark is a distributed computing framework optimized for big data processing. Understanding its internals helps in performance tuning, debugging, and architectural decisions

## Spark Architecture Overview

### Spark Components

#### Driver Program:
  The main entry point for Spark applications.
  It submits jobs, distributes tasks, and monitors execution.
  
#### Cluster Manager:

  Manages resource allocation (CPU, memory) across worker nodes.
  Can be YARN, Kubernetes, Mesos, or Standalone.

#### Executor:

  Runs on worker nodes and executes tasks.
  
  Each executor has its own memory and caches data locally.

#### Task:

  A unit of execution sent to an executor.
  
  Multiple tasks form a stage, and multiple stages form a job.

#### RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset):

  Spark’s fundamental immutable distributed data structure.
  
  Supports transformations (map, filter) and actions (count, collect).

### Architecture Flow:

  1. Driver creates an RDD and triggers an action.
  2. SparkContext translates this into a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).
  3. DAG Scheduler breaks the DAG into stages.
  4. Task Scheduler assigns tasks to executors.
  5. Executors execute tasks in parallel and store intermediate data.
  6. Final output is sent back to the driver.

### Spark Execution Flow:

DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)

Spark lazily evaluates transformations and builds a DAG before execution.

DAG helps optimize execution by reordering operations and reducing shuffles.


Example DAG for a Spark Job

df = spark.read.csv("data.csv")  # Stage 1: Read data
df = df.filter(df["col1"] > 100)  # Stage 2: Filter transformation (lazy)
df = df.groupBy("col2").count()  # Stage 3: GroupBy (causes shuffle)
df.show()  # Action triggers execution

### DAG Optimization:

1. Stage Splitting: Divides DAG into narrow and wide transformations.

2. Pipeline Execution: Executes multiple operations in a single stage.

3. Shuffle Optimization: Reduces expensive data movement between nodes.

Catalyst Optimizer

What is Catalyst Optimizer?

Spark SQL’s query optimizer that improves performance by:

  Reordering joins
  
  Predicate pushdown
  
  Column pruning
  
  Cost-based optimizations

Example: Analyzing a Query Plan

df = spark.read.parquet("data.parquet")

df_filtered = df.filter(df["col1"] > 100)

df_filtered.explain(True)  # Shows Optimized Execution Plan

Execution Plan Breakdown

== Physical Plan ==
Filter (col1 > 100)  -- Predicate Pushdown
Scan parquet data    -- Column Pruning

Predicate Pushdown: Filters applied before reading data, reducing I/O.

Column Pruning: Only loads required columns to save memory.

### Tungsten Engine

#### What is Tungsten?

Spark’s memory management engine that optimizes CPU efficiency.

Uses off-heap memory, cache-aware computation, and bytecode generation.

#### Tungsten Features

  1. Binary Processing: Data is stored in binary format (not JVM objects).
  
  2. Bytecode Generation: Converts queries into Java bytecode at runtime.
  
  3. Off-Heap Memory: Reduces JVM garbage collection overhead.
