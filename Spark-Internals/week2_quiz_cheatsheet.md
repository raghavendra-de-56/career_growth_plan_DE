## Cheat Sheet: Key Concepts

| Topic               | Summary                                                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Skew**       | Uneven distribution of keys in join operations; can be resolved with **salting** or **broadcast joins**. |
| **Salting**         | Adds random suffix to skewed keys to distribute load across partitions. |
| **Broadcast Join**  | Replicates smaller dataset to all executors; avoids shuffle-heavy operations. Ideal when one dataset is < 100MB. |
| **Delta Lake Merge**| Used for **upserts**. Maintains ACID transactions.                      |
| **ZORDER BY**       | Used after OPTIMIZE to cluster data by column for faster filtering.     |
| **Time Travel**     | Use `.option("versionAsOf", n)` or `.option("timestampAsOf", "...")` to query historical snapshots. |
| **OPTIMIZE**        | Compacts small files in Delta tables, improving read performance.        |
| **Orchestration**   | Use tools like Airflow or Databricks Workflows to chain and monitor pipeline steps. |
| **Schema Evolution**| Delta Lake supports `mergeSchema` and handles evolving schemas in production. |
| **Idempotency**     | Ensure pipelines can safely rerun without duplication or corruption.     |
