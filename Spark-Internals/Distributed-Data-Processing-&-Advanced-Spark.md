Here's a detailed breakdown of Week 2 tailored for a Staff Data Engineer interview preparation, with real-world scenarios, architecture insights, and interview-ready depth.

## Week 2: Distributed Data Processing & Advanced Spark

Main Focus Areas:

1. Spark optimization strategies
2. Handling real-world data skew
3. Internals of Delta Lake (transactional storage layer)
4. Scalable orchestration of data pipelines
5. Hands-on project reflecting real business use cases

### Spark Performance Optimization – Deep Dive

#### Why it Matters:
Interviewers often ask how you handle performance issues in large-scale pipelines. Showing knowledge of Spark internals and tuning indicates seniority.
#### Key Concepts:
Partitioning vs. Bucketing
1. Partitioning splits data across physical files (used by Spark and storage layer).
2. Bucketing helps optimize joins by pre-sorting data into buckets based on a key.

#### Catalyst Optimizer
1. Logical and physical plan optimizations.
df.explain(True) shows the transformations Spark applies before execution.

#### Tungsten Execution Engine
1. Improves memory use with off-heap storage.
2. Whole-stage code generation for fast query execution.

#### Shuffles & Join Strategies
1. Expensive in terms of disk + network IO.
2. Avoid shuffleHashJoin unless necessary.
3. Use broadcast joins for small dimension tables.
   
#### Spark UI Analysis

1. Use Spark UI to analyze slow jobs (look for stages with long GC, spills, skewed tasks).

### Handling Data Skew in Real Pipelines

#### Scenario:
A single customer generates 60% of your order data. During joins, a single executor gets overloaded and slows down the whole job.
#### Techniques:
1. Salting: Add a random number to the skewed key and replicate the join keys to spread the load.
2. Broadcast joins: When one dataset is small, you can broadcast it to all executors.
3. Repartitioning: Use .repartition() to evenly distribute data across partitions.

#### Hands-On:

1. Simulate skew with lit("customer_1")
2. Add a salt column using rand()
3. Reconstruct join keys with concat_ws()

### Delta Lake Internals & Advanced Features

#### Why it Matters:
Delta Lake is foundational to many production-grade Lakehouse architectures (especially in Databricks).
#### Concepts to Master:
Transaction Log
1. Stored at _delta_log/, consists of JSON + Parquet checkpoints.
2. Guarantees ACID properties using optimistic concurrency control.
Time Travel
1. Access historical versions using:
```df = spark.read.format("delta").option("versionAsOf", 2).load(path)```
Merge (Upserts)
1. Use DeltaTable API to do MERGE (update if matched, insert otherwise).
2. Schema evolution support with mergeSchema = true.
OPTIMIZE + ZORDER
1. OPTIMIZE compacts small files.
2. ZORDER helps skip irrelevant files during read (especially for filtering on common keys).

### Orchestration Patterns (Databricks Workflows + Airflow)

#### Why it Matters:
As a Staff Engineer, you're expected to define how pipelines are triggered, monitored, and recovered.
What to Learn:
1. Databricks Workflows: Built-in scheduler for jobs using notebooks or scripts.
2. Airflow DAGs:
   1. Declarative pipeline orchestration (common at many companies).
   2. Error handling: Use retries, failure hooks, alerting (Slack/email).
   3. Parameterization: Passing parameters to tasks (e.g., file dates, environment toggles).

### Real-World Project for Hands-On Practice

Use Case:

Large Retail Order Processing System

Data Sources:

Batch ingestion of orders, customers, and inventory.


Pipeline Stages:

1. Ingest parquet files into raw Delta Lake table.


2. Apply data skew logic (simulate high-volume customer).


3. Broadcast join with customer data.


4. Merge daily updates using Delta’s upsert feature.


5. Optimize and ZORDER on commonly filtered columns (customer_id, order_date).


6. Databricks Workflow triggers:

load_raw_data notebook

merge_updates notebook

Notification or downstream task




Key Goals:

Prove your skill in identifying bottlenecks.

Demonstrate mastery of Spark/Delta/Workflows.

Prepare for interview questions like:

“How do you handle long-running joins?”

“How do you ensure consistency in concurrent writes?”

“Can you walk through your orchestration strategy?”
