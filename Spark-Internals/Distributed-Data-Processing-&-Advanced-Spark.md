Here's a detailed breakdown of Week 2 tailored for a Staff Data Engineer interview preparation, with real-world scenarios, architecture insights, and interview-ready depth.

## Week 2: Distributed Data Processing & Advanced Spark

Main Focus Areas:

1. Spark optimization strategies
2. Handling real-world data skew
3. Internals of Delta Lake (transactional storage layer)
4. Scalable orchestration of data pipelines
5. Hands-on project reflecting real business use cases

1️⃣ Spark Performance Optimization – Deep Dive

Why it Matters:

Interviewers often ask how you handle performance issues in large-scale pipelines. Showing knowledge of Spark internals and tuning indicates seniority.

Key Concepts:

Partitioning vs. Bucketing

Partitioning splits data across physical files (used by Spark and storage layer).

Bucketing helps optimize joins by pre-sorting data into buckets based on a key.


Catalyst Optimizer

Logical and physical plan optimizations.

df.explain(True) shows the transformations Spark applies before execution.


Tungsten Execution Engine

Improves memory use with off-heap storage.

Whole-stage code generation for fast query execution.


Shuffles & Join Strategies

Expensive in terms of disk + network IO.

Avoid shuffleHashJoin unless necessary.

Use broadcast joins for small dimension tables.


Spark UI Analysis

Use Spark UI to analyze slow jobs (look for stages with long GC, spills, skewed tasks).

2️⃣ Handling Data Skew in Real Pipelines

Scenario:

A single customer generates 60% of your order data. During joins, a single executor gets overloaded and slows down the whole job.

Techniques:

Salting: Add a random number to the skewed key and replicate the join keys to spread the load.

Broadcast joins: When one dataset is small, you can broadcast it to all executors.

Repartitioning: Use .repartition() to evenly distribute data across partitions.


Hands-On:

Simulate skew with lit("customer_1")

Add a salt column using rand()

Reconstruct join keys with concat_ws()

3️⃣ Delta Lake Internals & Advanced Features

Why it Matters:

Delta Lake is foundational to many production-grade Lakehouse architectures (especially in Databricks).

Concepts to Master:

Transaction Log

Stored at _delta_log/, consists of JSON + Parquet checkpoints.

Guarantees ACID properties using optimistic concurrency control.


Time Travel

Access historical versions using:

df = spark.read.format("delta").option("versionAsOf", 2).load(path)


Merge (Upserts)

Use DeltaTable API to do MERGE (update if matched, insert otherwise).

Schema evolution support with mergeSchema = true.


OPTIMIZE + ZORDER

OPTIMIZE compacts small files.

ZORDER helps skip irrelevant files during read (especially for filtering on common keys).



---

4️⃣ Orchestration Patterns (Databricks Workflows + Airflow)

Why it Matters:

As a Staff Engineer, you're expected to define how pipelines are triggered, monitored, and recovered.

What to Learn:

Databricks Workflows: Built-in scheduler for jobs using notebooks or scripts.

Airflow DAGs: Declarative pipeline orchestration (common at many companies).

Error handling: Use retries, failure hooks, alerting (Slack/email).

Parameterization: Passing parameters to tasks (e.g., file dates, environment toggles).

5️⃣ Real-World Project for Hands-On Practice

Use Case:

Large Retail Order Processing System

Data Sources:

Batch ingestion of orders, customers, and inventory.


Pipeline Stages:

1. Ingest parquet files into raw Delta Lake table.


2. Apply data skew logic (simulate high-volume customer).


3. Broadcast join with customer data.


4. Merge daily updates using Delta’s upsert feature.


5. Optimize and ZORDER on commonly filtered columns (customer_id, order_date).


6. Databricks Workflow triggers:

load_raw_data notebook

merge_updates notebook

Notification or downstream task




Key Goals:

Prove your skill in identifying bottlenecks.

Demonstrate mastery of Spark/Delta/Workflows.

Prepare for interview questions like:

“How do you handle long-running joins?”

“How do you ensure consistency in concurrent writes?”

“Can you walk through your orchestration strategy?”
