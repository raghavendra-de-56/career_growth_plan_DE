### Why Do We Need These Architectures?

Modern systems deal with:

Huge volumes of data (e.g., IoT, logs, transactions, etc.)

The need for real-time analytics (fraud detection, recommendation engines)

The requirement for accurate batch processing (monthly reports, data lakes)

Traditional architectures struggled to meet both real-time and batch needs efficiently â€” hence, Lambda and Kappa were introduced.
