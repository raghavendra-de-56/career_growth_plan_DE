### Real-Time Streaming Architecture

#### Core Concepts:

Data Ingestion: Kafka or AWS Kinesis as the real-time data bus.

Stream Processing: Spark Structured Streaming or Flink for transformations.

Data Enrichment: Join with static/batch data for context.

Sink: Delta Lake tables, Event Hubs, Elasticsearch, or Redis for fast access.

Key Patterns:

Exactly-once processing via checkpointing and idempotent writes.

Watermarking for late data handling.

Backpressure and windowed aggregations.


Example Use Case:

> Real-time IoT sensor data from delivery trucks ingested via Kafka, processed with Spark Structured Streaming, enriched with location metadata, stored in Delta Lake Bronze → Silver → Gold tables.


### Delta Lake Advanced Concepts

Key Features:

ACID Transactions: Guaranteed via transaction log (_delta_log).

Time Travel: Query data at previous versions using VERSION AS OF.

Schema Evolution: Supports mergeSchema and overwriteSchema.

Optimize & Z-Order: Used to improve query performance via data skipping.

Real-World Tip:

For large-scale production:

Use OPTIMIZE + ZORDER BY on Gold tables used by BI tools.

Schedule VACUUM with a data retention policy.

Sample:
```
df.write.format("delta")\
  .option("mergeSchema", "true")\
  .mode("append")\
  .save("/mnt/datalake/bronze/iot_stream")
```

### Databricks SQL

Usage in Real-Time:

Querying Silver and Gold tables updated by streaming jobs.

Supports Materialized Views, Live Tables, and SQL Alerts.

Delta Live Tables (DLT) helps orchestrate ETL pipelines with built-in quality checks.


Sample SQL:

-- Real-time sales per minute
```
SELECT window(timestamp, '1 minute') AS time_window,
       product_id,
       SUM(quantity_sold)
FROM gold_sales_streaming
GROUP BY time_window, product_id;
````

### Kafka-based Streaming Pipelines

Key Features:

Kafka Topics = logical partitions for different event types.

Consumer Groups = parallel stream processing.

Offsets = used to track processed data.


Spark Streaming Integration:
```
df = spark.readStream.format("kafka")\
  .option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092")\
  .option("subscribe", "sensor-data")\
  .load()

parsed = df.selectExpr("CAST(value AS STRING)")\
  .withColumn("json", from_json("value", schema))
```

### Real-Time Aggregation & Deduplication

Deduplication using watermark + dropDuplicates

Window-based Aggregations with late event handling


Example:
```
df \
  .withWatermark("event_time", "10 minutes") \
  .dropDuplicates(["device_id", "event_time"]) \
  .groupBy(window("event_time", "1 hour"), "device_id") \
  .agg(avg("temperature"))
```

### Best Practices for Production

Enable checkpointing to S3/DBFS for fault tolerance.

Use structured logging and alerting for anomalies.

Combine streaming + batch logic (Lambda/Kappa architecture).

Monitor with Datadog, Prometheus, or Databricks Observability.
