1. Data Modeling Fundamentals:
    - Entities: Represent real-world objects or concepts (e.g., customers, orders).
    - Attributes: Describe characteristics of entities (e.g., customer name, order date).
    - Relationships: Define connections between entities (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many).

2. Data Warehousing:
    - Star Schema: A dimensional modeling technique with a central fact table surrounded by dimension tables.
    - Snowflake Schema: A variation of star schema with normalized dimension tables.
    - Fact Tables: Store measurable data (e.g., sales amount, quantity).
    - Dimension Tables: Store descriptive data (e.g., customer information, product details).

3. Data Governance:
    - Data Quality: Ensuring data accuracy, completeness, and consistency.
    - Data Security: Protecting data from unauthorized access and breaches.
    - Data Compliance: Adhering to regulations and standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

4. Data Modeling Patterns:
    - Normalization: Organizing data to minimize redundancy and improve data integrity.
    - Denormalization: Optimizing data for query performance by allowing some redundancy.
