### Project Name: Retail Order Processing System

#### Project Scenario

You are building a production-grade Order Management Platform for a retailer company.

Orders come both as batch files (daily loads) and real-time events (order updates, payments).

You need to handle data quality, schema evolution, alerting, monitoring, and lineage â€” all production ready.
