## Use Case:

Self-Service Enterprise Data Platform on Databricks
Support ingestion, transformation, governance, observability, and monitoring in a cost-effective and scalable way across domains.

### 1. Architecture Diagram Overview

Iâ€™ve prepared an architecture that includes:

Ingestion (Batch/Streaming)

Orchestration

Processing Layers (Bronze, Silver, Gold)

Unity Catalog (Security & Governance)

CI/CD pipelines

Monitoring and Alerting


### 2. Components Breakdown

#### 1. Data Ingestion Layer

Purpose: Ingest data from multiple sources (real-time & batch).

Components:

Auto Loader (for file-based sources like S3/GCS/ADLS)

Efficient, scalable file ingestion with schema inference.


Structured Streaming (for Kafka, EventHub, Kinesis)

Handles IoT/real-time pipelines with exactly-once semantics.


Databricks Partner Connect (for tools like Fivetran, Informatica)

For SaaS-based ingestion from ERP, CRM, etc.


Best Practices:

Use schema evolution support with Auto Loader.

Store raw data in Bronze Layer (append-only, immutable).

#### 2. Processing & Storage Layer (Medallion Architecture)

Bronze (Raw):

Stores raw ingested data (streaming + batch).

Time-partitioned.

Schema-on-read.


Silver (Refined):

Cleansed, joined, enriched data.

Business logic applied.

Schema-on-write with validation.


Gold (Aggregated):

Curated datasets used by BI tools and ML models.

Star/snowflake schemas, SCDs applied here.


Delta Lake is the core table format:

ACID transactions

Time travel

Schema enforcement & evolution

Performance optimizations (Z-order, OPTIMIZE, VACUUM)


#### 3. Orchestration Layer

Purpose: Manage end-to-end workflows & dependencies.

Components:

Databricks Workflows:

Native orchestration for notebooks, JARs, and SQL.

Supports task-level dependencies, retries, alerts.


Apache Airflow (via Astronomer or MWAA):

DAG-based control.

Integrates with Databricks jobs via REST API.


dbt Cloud or dbt Core:

SQL-based transformation layer.

Excellent for managing modular models and lineage.

#### 4. Data Governance Layer

Unity Catalog (Core governance engine):

Centralized access control (fine-grained).

Lineage tracking at table, column, and notebook level.

Schema/data versioning support.

Cross-workspace policies via metastore sharing.

Native support for tags, classifications (e.g., PII, HIPAA).


Table ACLs, Row/Column-Level Security, and Dynamic Views for sensitive data masking.

#### 5. Metadata Management & Data Lineage

Built-in tools:

Unity Catalog Lineage UI: Automatic column-level lineage.

Databricks Notebook Lineage: Tracks upstream/downstream transformations.

External options:

DataHub / Amundsen / Collibra: For enterprise metadata federation.

dbt: For transformation lineage in the SQL modeling layer.

#### 6. Observability & Quality Monitoring

Data Quality:

Delta Expectations (built-in constraints at write time).

Great Expectations (custom quality checks with validation reports).

Deequ (for advanced profiling & constraints on Spark).

Monitoring:

Databricks SQL Alerts

Unity Catalog Audit Logs

Metrics streaming to Prometheus + Grafana

Cloud-native observability (AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, GCP Ops)


#### 7. CI/CD and Automation

Purpose: Reproducible, versioned, automated pipelines.

Components:

Databricks Repos: Git-integrated notebooks and workflows.

CI/CD with GitHub Actions / Azure DevOps / GitLab CI:

Automatically deploy notebooks, workflows, SQL, dashboards.

Support for unit testing with pytest, dbx, dbt tests.

Secrets & Configs:

Store secrets in Databricks Secrets API.

Use environment variables for workspace-level configs.

#### 8. Consumption Layer

Reporting:

Power BI, Tableau, Looker, Databricks SQL Dashboards.


ML/AI:

Feature Store: Unified management of features across teams.

MLflow: Track experiments, model versions, deployments.


APIs:

REST APIs or Databricks SQL APIs for serving Gold data.


#### 9. Cost Optimization Strategies

Use Photon Engine (up to 20x faster).

Use Auto-scaling + Spot instances for clusters.

Monitor with Cluster Utilization Metrics.

OPTIMIZE + ZORDER for reducing query latency.

Delta Caching + Materialized Views for high-volume use cases.
